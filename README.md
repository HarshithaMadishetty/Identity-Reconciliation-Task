# Identity-Reconciliation-Task
Greetings,

I am Harshitha, and I undertook a project assigned by Bitespeed titled "Identity Reconciliation." 
This application was developed using Express.js, a robust web application framework. 
The database utilized for this project is MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.
The application is hosted at https://identity-reconciliation-taskk.onrender.com

Thank you for your interest in exploring this project.
